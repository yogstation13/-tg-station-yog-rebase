			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Some asshole poured a whole beaker of deadly chemicals into the atmospherics scrubbers. Ejection of contents may be deadlier than normal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now stabilize unstable mutation toxin with different chems to get the race you want. Check the /tg/ wiki for how. Combining different mutation toxins may have different effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most traitor poisons have been made deadlier.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Neurotoxin and cyanide have been made more viable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">NT has updated their analyzers with better programs. Slime scanners will detect if a slime is rabid, who it's friends are, if it was fed a mutation potion, if the slime is in stasis, if it was attacked, and more. Health analyzers will alert you if your patient is having a heart attack. Analyzers will detect more gas types.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">This isn't really related to anything but did you know that if you give a slime morphine or frost oil it slows down, and you can become better friends with a slime by feeding it plasma? Or just order it to attack people by saying 'attack (person's full name.) Seriously, I was surprised to find a lot of this stuff out.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nuclear Operatives can now customize the message broadcast to the station when declaring war. Ported from /tg/.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Chieftains are more intelligent than your average ashwalker. They can operate machinery with ease, and are able to speak human.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a chieftain dies, the main nest will take 30 seconds to automatically spawn another chieftain egg.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a Chieftain Ashwalker is sacrificed, they speed up the process to spawn another chieftain egg.</li>
