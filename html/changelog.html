			<h3 class="author">Joan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="wip">This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious servant or clockwork obelisk.</li>
				<li class="wip">Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target is a clockwork obelisk.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby humans.</li>
				<li class="wip">The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations, and the druggy effect from servants.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from non-servants.</li>
				<li class="wip">The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant, it will still heal their corpse.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power to function.</li>
				<li class="wip">Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.</li>
				<li class="wip">Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely to damage the invoker.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself. You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be set on fire.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Quiltyquilty updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Xhuis updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but not when it actually spawns).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents to seemed to duplicate themselves.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">coiax updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your capsule has inside by examining it.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">phil235 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does. Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw any more blood from it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Joan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Clockwork structures can be damaged by projectiles and simple animals, and will actually drop debris when destroyed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">AIs and Cyborgs that serve Ratvar can control clockwork airlocks and clockwork windoors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The clockwork proselytizer can now proselytize windows, doors, grilles, and windoors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The clockwork proselytizer can proselytize wall gears and alloy shards to produce replicant alloy. It can also proselytize replicant alloy to refill, in addition to refilling by attacking it with alloy.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The clockwork proselytizer can replace clockwork floors with clockwork walls and vice versa.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ratvar will convert windoors, tables, and computers in addition to everything else.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ratvar now moves around much faster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ratvar and Nar-Sie will break each other's objects.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The blind eye from a broken ocular warden now serves as a belligerent eye instead of as replicant alloy. The pinion lock from a deconstructed clockwork airlock now serves as a vanguard cogwheel instead of as replicant alloy.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Clockwork walls drop a wall gear when removed by a welding tool. The wall gear is dense, but can be climbed over or unwrenched, and drops alloy shards when broken. Clockwork walls drop alloy shards when broken by other means.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Nar-Sie wandering while battling Ratvar.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Ratvarian Spears now last for the proper 5 minute duration.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Servant communication now has ghost follow links.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New sigil sprites, courtesy Skowron.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">RemieRichards updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">X-TheDark updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's was less).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">coiax updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="bugfix">Laughter demons should now always let their friends go when asked correctly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather than when it starts cloning.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!</li>

			<h3 class="author">Xhuis updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork marauders can now smash walls and tables.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Servants are no longer turned into harvesters by Nar-Sie but instead take heavy brute damage and begin to bleed. Similarly, cultists are no longer converted by Ratvar but instead take heavy fire damage and are set ablaze.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable, acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes unconscious or dies, it will leap free.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing a normal airlock or from Ratvar.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added ratvarian windows. They are created when Ratvar twists the form of a normal window, and there are both single-direction and full-tile variants.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Non-servants can no longer use clockwork proselytizers or mending motors.</li>

				<li class="tweak">There are now level gates at high levels. R&D scientists will need help from others to get past these level gates.</li>
