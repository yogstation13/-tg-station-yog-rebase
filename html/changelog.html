				<li class="rscadd">Lavaland mobs have been changed.
Weavers now ventcrawl, can pass over tables, drop less loot, move slower, hit weaker, inject less deadly poisons, and have worse vision.
Weavers have developed anger issues and will get very nasty very fast when their health is reduced.
Goliaths now drop more loot.
Goliath hide plates now offer more protection to RIPLEY-series mecha.
Legions and Watchers do slightly less damage.
Watchers have realized how shitty they were. Thankfully, watcher scientists have attacked the issue with gusto- beams now actually freeze the target again and confuse them as well. Charcoal should get rid of most of the issue quickly. Coffee works too. Watchers also drop slightly more loot.
Watchers have realized that because they are levitating eyeballs, they should not fall into chasms anymore.
Lavaland mobs now actually emote and are gold slime makable. Aside from legion. Nobody likes legion, or his dad, Legion.
Ashwalkers have reported that their gutlunches are now producing healing chemicals with more efficiency, before screaming LIZARD PRIDE and running around naked hooting.</li>
