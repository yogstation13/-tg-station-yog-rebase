	credits_reload_from_db(mob): Returns the number of credits for the given `mob`
	credits_top(num): Gives you the top `num` of players by credits earnt
	credits_earn(mob, num): Gives `num` credits to `mob`
	credits_spend(mob, num): Takes `num` credits from `mob`
	credits_set(mob, num): Sets `mob` credits to `num`
